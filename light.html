			<p class="description_txt"> As a project for Prototyping and Fabrication, my team partner and I were prompted to build a bluetooth motorized chassis. After discussing different models and designs for the robot, we decided to go with a simple, triangular shaped chassis that had two motors on each side that we could easily program to move forward/backward/left/right. The triangular shape allowed us to maintain lightness and durability because it could flip over and we would still have control. This project helped me develop skills in laser cutting, Aruduino, Fusion 360/3D printing, and the iterative design process. <br> <br><span class="boldwrd"> Timeline: </span> 4 weeks - Summer 2019 <br> <span class = "boldwrd"> Team: </span> 2 people <br> <span class= "boldwrd"> Design challenge: </span> Create a bluetooth motorized chassis. <br>  </p>

			<p class="description_txt_1"> Our initial idea for this project was to create movement through rotating the outer planetary gears. We envisioned using a rubber tread around the gears and motorizing the central gear in order to create movement. We believed that the triangular shape would work best because it would be light, stable, and fast. </p>

			<p class="description_txt_1"> Following our initial cardboard prototype, we laser cut .25‚Äù plywood and attached our motor to the center gear, which was used to spin the outer gears. We used a gear piece from another commercial motororized chassis, and replicated this gear by laser cutting and stacking the plywood to get a perfect fit. For the body of the prototype, we cut multiple slots out so we could find the best fit and placement for the BLE feather and batteries. </p>

			<p class="description_txt_1"> We 3D printed wheels and treads using flex, and made the rest of the body using clear acrylic. It took multiple adjustments to find the perfect fit for the wheels and tread, by making sure there was not too much or too little slack. We made the top hole adjustable so we could slide the wheels on and off, and created washers to support the wheels onto the body. Using the same motors and BLE feather, we assembled the rest of the body similar to the wooden prototype, and we made cases for each of the components with easy access to switch them in and out. </p>
