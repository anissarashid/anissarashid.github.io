				<p class="description_txt_1"> Smart cities use Internet of Things devices and sensors to collect data, which is then used to inform models and algorithms that will improve operations in the city. While these technologies are implemented to improve the quality of life that residents experience, massive data collection comes with many security and privacy threats. Unencrypted IoT devices in homes and hospitals, automated busses, power grids and water treatment plants, drones, and more all have major vulernabilities to hackers and user privacy threats.

				<p class="description_txt_1">   
				<span style="font-weight: 600;, font-size: 23;"> 1. Transparency </span>
				<br> Both end users and experts have emphasized the importance for products and services to be transparent in <span style="font-weight: 600;"> how they collect </span> and <span style="font-weight: 600;"> what they do </span> with user data. <br>

				<br> <span style="font-weight: 600;, font-size: 23;"> 2. Trust </span>
				<br> Experts believe that products and services need to earn trust through being transparent and communicating the <span style="font-weight: 600;"> costs and benefits </span> of using a product from both a  <span style="font-weight: 600;"> security and privacy perspective. </span> Users were more likely to trust products that were commonly used among their friends and family, without thinking about the security risks. <br>

				<br> <span style="font-weight: 600;, font-size: 23;"> 3. Convenience </span>
				<br> Smart cities are trying to  <span style="font-weight: 600;"> optimize efficiency </span> and <span style="font-weight: 600;"> improve the quality of life</span> for their residents. Many users have expressed their priority for convenience over security, while experts view security as their top concern.

				<br> We found that users cared about transparency from companies, with what data was collected and how this data was used. Over half of our interviewees have experienced credit card loss or wallet theft and needed to replace all of their credit and debit cards, Drivers License, and other important personal IDs. However, over half of our users also expressed their priority for convenience over security, and were willing to sacrifice their data and privacy for a convenient product. On the other hand, we found that experts viewed security as their top concern, and expressed worry over the security and privacy risks among IoT devices, GPS tracking, social media, and other data collecting devices. With this <span style="font-weight: 600"> discrepency between users and experts, we found our opportunity for design. </span>

				<p class="description_txt_1">  We decided to create a payment and identification storage product that can be a mobile application, tablet, or keychain. This is a design solution for the future of smart cities, where all retailers and governments will accept and issue digital forms of payment and identification. Our product distinguishes itself from its competitors because of its commitment to transparency, privacy, and security. Unlike other virtual wallets, users will know exactly how their information is stored and that no thrid party has access to their traffic. We explain the technology to users in a digestible, user-friendly format which makes understanding the importance of cybersecurity easier and more accessible. We also envision this product to be publicly available so that people without smart phones can also make convenient and secure transactions. </p>

				Overall, I'm satisfied with how this project came together. I learned so much about cybersecurity throughout this process, and I gained new design thinking skills by applying methodologies that I hadn't explored before. I believe that our project helps guide cybersecurity awareness and financial literacy for users, and I think it's very important to design with privacy and security in mind as we enter a new age of technology and data collection. If our team had more time, I would've liked to do more usability testing with our medium-fidelity prototypes, and I will continue developing Papaya products and mockups. I feel much more confident with product design and UI/UX design, and I hope to complete more projects like this in the future.
