			<p class="description_txt_1"> Smart cities use Internet of Things devices and sensors to collect data, which is then used to inform models and algorithms that will improve operations in the city. While these technologies are implemented to improve the quality of life that residents experience, massive data collection comes with many security and privacy threats. Unencrypted IoT devices in homes and hospitals, automated busses, power grids and water treatment plants, drones, and more all have major vulernabilities to hackers and user privacy threats.

			<p class="description_txt_1"> After interviews with 5 experts in cybersecurity, sustainability, and blockchain, 3 stakeholders, and 5 end users, as well as competitive analysis, 2x2 matrices, and clustering, our team was able to narrow down a problem space within smart cities. We found that payment and identification systems are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and were a common concern among users. We tailored our HMW statement to: 
			<br> <span style="font-weight: 500;"> How might we help payment and identification processes feel more secure and convenient for all users, including those without access to smartphones? </span></p>

			<p class="description_txt_1"> We found that users cared about transparency from companies, with what data was collected and how this data was used. Over half of our interviewees have experienced credit card loss or wallet theft and needed to replace all of their credit and debit cards, Drivers License, and other important personal IDs. However, over half of our users also expressed their priority for convenience over security, and were willing to sacrifice their data and privacy for a convenient product. On the other hand, we found that experts viewed security as their top concern, and expressed worry over the security and privacy risks among IoT devices, GPS tracking, social media, and other data collecting devices. With this discrepency between users and experts, we found our opportunity for design. </p>

		<p class="description_txt"> <span class= "boldwrd"> Our Solution </span> </p>
		<div class="pics">
			<p class="description_txt_1">  We decided to create a payment and identification storage product that can be a mobile application, tablet, or keychain. This is a design solution for the future of smart cities, where all retailers and governments will accept and issue digital forms of payment and identification. Our product distinguishes itself from its competitors because of its commitment to transparency, privacy, and security. Unlike other virtual wallets, users will know exactly how their information is stored and that no thrid party has access to their traffic. We explain the technology to users in a digestible, user-friendly format which makes understanding the importance of cybersecurity easier and more accessible. We also envision this product to be publicly available so that people without smart phones can also make convenient and secure transactions. </p>

			<p class="description_txt_1">
				Overall, I'm satisfied with how this project came together. I learned so much about cybersecurity throughout this process, and I gained new design thinking skills by applying methodologies that I hadn't explored before. I believe that our project helps guide cybersecurity awareness and financial literacy for users, and I think it's very important to design with privacy and security in mind as we enter a new age of technology and data collection. If our team had more time, I would've liked to do more usability testing with our medium-fidelity prototypes, and I will continue developing Papaya products and mockups. I feel much more confident with product design and UI/UX design, and I hope to complete more projects like this in the future.
