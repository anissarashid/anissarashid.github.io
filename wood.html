			<p class="description_txt_1"> My idea for this project was to use planetary gears and linkages to convert the circular motion of the gears to linear motion. I sketched out many potential ways to stabilize and connect the linkages to the central planetary gears, and had many test cuts for the perfect fit of the gears. After many iterations, I found that I had to layer three gears (cut from .25" plywood) in order to make the gears stable. </p>

			<p class="description_txt_1"> This was the Adobe Illustrator file I used for my final prototype, along with multiple test cuts of different gear sizes and linkage sizes in order to find the best fit. I laser cut .25" plywood and used wood glue to build the prototype. After working with these test pieces, I found that it was best to lay the linkages horizonally along the board rather than vertically, and I created the linear motion by fixing one of the linkages to the outer planetary gear, and loosely connecting that to the second linkage, which would slide in between the outer railings. </p>

			<p class="description_txt_1"> We 3D printed wheels and treads using flex, and made the rest of the body using clear acrylic. It took multiple adjustments to find the perfect fit for the wheels and tread, by making sure there was not too much or too little slack. We made the top hole adjustable so we could slide the wheels on and off, and created washers to support the wheels onto the body. Using the same motors and BLE feather, we assembled the rest of the body similar to the wooden prototype, and we made cases for each of the components with easy access to switch them in and out. In future iterations, I would have sanded the gears more to create smoother motion. </p>
