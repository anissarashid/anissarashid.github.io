			<p class="description_txt"> As a project for Visual Thinking (Fall 2019), I created this simple site as a response to our prompt of creating a distributable, nondiscrete piece of art. 
				<br> After thinking about the types of distributable products I could create, I noticed that mental health on college campuses is often neglected, so I wanted to design a website to target one facet of this complex issue. I decided to build a website with a breathing activity, which I saw as a potential solution to help reduce some of the stress students experience, and wanted to ensure that this resource was accessible and intuitive to use.

			<p class="description_txt_1"> Instead of using a cirle, I used three.js - a JavaScript 3D library- to create a 3D sphere that I scaled using a sine function, in order to best replicate the breath. I decided to keep "inhale" and "exhale" on the sides of the sphere rather than inside the sphere to make the movement cleaner and less distracting for the user. I also used a purple to blue gradient in order to foster calmness and serenity. </p>
