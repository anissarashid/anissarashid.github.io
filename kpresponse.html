				<p class="description_txt_1"> People are remembered for their ideas, not their names. Most people view “innocent until proven guilty” to be a key pillar of our criminal justice system, but it is insignificant that it comes from Voltaire.  <br> <br>
				Admittedly idealistic, I would want to leave behind <span style="color: #1200db"> an idea or new way of thinking. </span> <br> <br>
				<span style="color: #1200db">Climate change</span> is accelerating and heading towards irreversible damage. The gini coefficient, representing <span style="color: #1200db">income inequality,</span> has dramatically increased over time. Drug prices, the cost of healthcare, and the cost of education are all heavily rising. Racism and <span style="color: #1200db">white supremacy</span> are still deeply rooted in our institutions. <br> <br>
				I do not believe that any of these complex issues can be thoroughly solved through our existing political system, which fundamentally <span style="color: #1200db">prioritizes capital gains </span> over all. I do, however, believe that all of these issues have a common theme, and that if <span style="color: #1200db">people, policies, and especially corporations </span> adopted a new way of thinking about these issues, we could come closer to a more equitable solution. <br> <br>
				<span style="color: #1200db">Empathy </span> is one of the most powerful values one can have. In a world where empathy had a higher priority than profit, we might see eco-consciousness rise and global efforts to reduce climate change happen. We might see inequality decrease, as people would prioritize the well being and basic needs for their communities over the S&P 500. <br> <br>
				While I strive to achieve this on a micro level, given the chance to make such an impact, I would absolutely introduce a <span style="color: #1200db">cultural, political, and economic shift in our values towards empathy.</span> <br> <br>

				</p>

			<div class="pics" id="his" >
				<p class="description_txt_1"> Growing up hearing stories from my grandfather, who migrated to Bangladesh after the Partition of India with his single mother and siblings, entirely shaped my perspective. Hearing stories from my father, who grew up in Nigeria, Bangladesh, and eventually a small apartment in Alameda, instilled in me the strongest sense of gratitude and work ethic.  <br> <br>

				<span style="color: #1200db">They relied on education for survival, and in turn, I have never taken it for granted. </span> During my time at UC Berkeley, I will have completed two majors and a certificate due to my love for learning. <br> <br>
				One of the most meaningful experiences I’ve had was taking CS 70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory. I took this class after having already declared Data Science and Economics, and did not need it for any requirement. The only reason I had for taking this class was that I had taken multivariable calculus and linear algebra, and wanted to learn a new sector of mathematics. The course was incredibly challenging, I poured over 15 hours a week into learning the material, yet I was still struggling to keep up. I had the deepest pit in my stomach walking out of that final because <span style="color: #1200db">it felt like I had failed that class and failed myself. </span> <br> <br>

				I did not fail CS 70, nor did I do as well as I had hoped, but I came to a huge self-realization. <span style="color: #1200db">I was proud of myself for putting so much effort into something even though it meant nothing,</span> and I recognized how strong my work ethic and motivations are across everything that I apply myself to.
