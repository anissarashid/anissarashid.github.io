				<p class="description_txt_1"> I have become an avid user of Pinterest because of my position as a Creative Director for my university's arts and fashion publication. The platform has been extremely useful for my team and I, and it has become a central way for me to put together creative inspiration. As a Creative Director, I am responsible for creating a theme that can support four print shoots for each biannual issue that we produce. Pinterest has been the easiest way for me find and group images that materialize our concepts for moodboards and slide decks. 
				<br> <br> Pinterest has a beautiful design system already, so I did not want to do an entire redesign of Pinterest, and chose to focus on in specific and small features to improve the user's experience.

				<br> I decided to go through the Pinterest Home Page, Search Page, and Profile with an open mind and take note of its strengths and weaknesses. I also collected Pinterest feedback from reviews on the Apple App Store. <br>

				<br> <span style="font-weight: 600;, font-size: 23;"> 2. User Research </span>
				<br> I decided to conduct interviews and observations among a range of Pinterest users, from low to high usage. During these interviews, I also led an observational study where I observed the way users interacted with the interface, noting where weaknesses may lie. <br>

				<span style="font-weight: 600;, font-size: 23;"> 1. Transparency </span>
				<br> Both end users and experts have emphasized the importance for products and services to be transparent in <span style="font-weight: 600;"> how they collect </span> and <span style="font-weight: 600;"> what they do </span> with user data. <br>

				<br> <span style="font-weight: 600;, font-size: 23;"> 2. Trust </span>
				<br> Experts believe that products and services need to earn trust through being transparent and communicating the <span style="font-weight: 600;"> costs and benefits </span> of using a product from both a  <span style="font-weight: 600;"> security and privacy perspective. </span> Users were more likely to trust products that were commonly used among their friends and family, without thinking about the security risks. <br>

				<br> <span style="font-weight: 600;, font-size: 23;"> 3. Convenience </span>
				<br> Smart cities are trying to  <span style="font-weight: 600;"> optimize efficiency </span> and <span style="font-weight: 600;"> improve the quality of life</span> for their residents. Many users have expressed their priority for convenience over security, while experts view security as their top concern.

				<p class="description_txt_1">  We decided to create a payment and identification storage product that can be a mobile application, tablet, or keychain. This is a design solution for the future of smart cities, where all retailers and governments will accept and issue digital forms of payment and identification. Our product distinguishes itself from its competitors because of its commitment to transparency, privacy, and security. Unlike other virtual wallets, users will know exactly how their information is stored and that no thrid party has access to their traffic. We explain the technology to users in a digestible, user-friendly format which makes understanding the importance of cybersecurity easier and more accessible. We also envision this product to be publicly available so that people without smart phones can also make convenient and secure transactions. </p>

			<p class="description_txt_1">
				Overall, I'm satisfied with how this project came together. I learned so much about cybersecurity throughout this process, and I gained new design thinking skills by applying methodologies that I hadn't explored before. I believe that our project helps guide cybersecurity awareness and financial literacy for users, and I think it's very important to design with privacy and security in mind as we enter a new age of technology and data collection. If our team had more time, I would've liked to do more usability testing with our medium-fidelity prototypes, and I will continue developing Papaya products and mockups. I feel much more confident with product design and UI/UX design, and I hope to complete more projects like this in the future.
