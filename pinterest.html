			<div class="pics" id="his" >
				<p class="description_txt_1"> I have become an avid user of Pinterest because of my position as a Creative Director for my university's arts and fashion publication. The platform has been extremely useful for my team and I, and it has become a central way for me to put together creative inspiration. As a CD, I am responsible for creating a theme that can support four print shoots for each biannual issue that we produce. Pinterest has been the easiest way for me find and group images that materialize our concepts for moodboards and slide decks. 
				<br> <br> Working on this design project alone was definitely intimidating because I didn't want this project to simply reflect my own, preexisting perspective of Pinterest and I believe that collaboration can always bring in well-rounded and valuable insight. I tried as best I could to be self aware of my biases going in, and that this project will not be inclusive or representative of all Pinterest users due to the constraints of this design challenge.

				<span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 23px;"> 1. Product Research </span>
				<br> I decided to go through the Pinterest Home Page, Search Page, and Profile Page with an open mind and take note of its strengths and weaknesses. <br>

				<br> <span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 23px;"> 2. User Research </span>
				<br> I conducted three interviews and observations among a range of Pinterest users, from low to high usage. During these interviews, I also led an observational study where I observed the way users interacted with the interface, noting where weaknesses may lie. <br>

				<p class="description_txt_1"> To get a high-level overview of the strengths and weaknesses of Pinterest's current design system, I took notes on the Home Page, Search Page, Profile Page, and Card Page. I wanted to navigate through Pinterest before honing in on the specific feature I redesigned.  <br>

				<br> <br> <span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 23px;"> Initial Thoughts:</span>
				<br> <span style="font-size: 20px;"> 1. There were a few inconsistencies across pages. For example - sometimes a search filter on the right hand side of the search bar appeared, sometimes there were filter tags on the top of the results page. </span>
				<br> <span style="font-size: 20px;"> 2. The search engine filtered its output by the description name of the card, rather than the card's visual features. </span>
				<br> <span style="font-size: 20px;"> 3. The card itself did not have tags or defining features in the description to help with filtering. There was no option on the desktop version to save the "more like this" for each card or board. </span>

				<p class="description_txt_1"> In a narrow sense, Pinterest has an amazing image sorting algorithm, yet the actual search feature does not seem to give users the images they are looking for.

				Overall, I'm satisfied with how this project came together. I learned so much about cybersecurity throughout this process, and I gained new design thinking skills by applying methodologies that I hadn't explored before. I believe that our project helps guide cybersecurity awareness and financial literacy for users, and I think it's very important to design with privacy and security in mind as we enter a new age of technology and data collection. If our team had more time, I would've liked to do more usability testing with our medium-fidelity prototypes, and I will continue developing Papaya products and mockups. I feel much more confident with product design and UI/UX design, and I hope to complete more projects like this in the future.
